# Internet Identity Integration Sample

This project demonstrates the integration of Internet Identity (II) authentication into an Internet Computer application, following the tutorial from [DFINITY's Internet Identity Integration Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/identity/internet-identity/integrate-internet-identity).

## Features

- Internet Identity authentication
- Simple "Who am I?" functionality to display user principal
- Local development environment setup

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install the IC SDK
- Node.js and npm

### Local Development

1. Start the local replica:

```bash
dfx start --background
```

2. Deploy the canisters:

```bash
dfx deploy
```

3. For frontend development with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start a development server at `http://localhost:3000`

### Internet Identity Configuration

The project includes a local instance of the Internet Identity canister for development purposes. When deployed locally, you'll be able to create test identities that should not be used in production.

## Project Structure

- `src/ii_backend/` - Motoko backend canister
- `src/ii_frontend/` - Frontend application code
- Internet Identity integration using `@dfinity/auth-client`

## Testing

The project can be tested using the Internet Identity Playwright plugin. See the [official documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/identity/internet-identity/integrate-internet-identity#end-to-end-testing) for more details on setting up end-to-end tests.

# Default README from `dfx new`

Welcome to your new `ii` project and to the Internet Computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with `ii`, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd ii/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
